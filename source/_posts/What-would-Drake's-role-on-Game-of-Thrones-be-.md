#  What would Drake's role on Game of Thrones be? 

Drake is a Canadian rapper, singer, songwriter, and actor. He first gained recognition in 2009 from his role on the television series Degrassi: The Next Generation. Drake would be an excellent candidate for the role of Theon Greyjoy on Game of Thrones.

Theon Greyjoy is a character that has a tortured past. He was raised by his father Balon Greyjoy to be the heir to the Iron Islands, but was taken hostage by the Stark family at a young age. He eventually became part of the Stark household and was treated poorly by Robb Stark. After Robb's death, Theon decided to betray House Stark and take Winterfell for himself, but was ultimately defeated by Ramsay Bolton and his forces.

Drake has shown that he can play a character with a tortured past in his role on Degrassi: The Next Generation. He would be able to bring depth to Theon Greyjoy's character and help viewers connect with him. Additionally, Drake is no stranger to performing in front of large audiences or working under high pressure conditions, both of which would be necessary for a successful role on Game of Thrones.

#  Why do fans think that Drake should appear on the show? 

There are many reasons why fans believe that Drake should appear on the show. Some feel that he would be a perfect fit, given his Canadian roots. Others think that he could bring some much-needed celebrity firepower to the series. 

Drake has shown interest in the show in the past. In a 2017 interview with Beats 1 Radio, he said that he’d love to make an appearance on “Game of Thrones”. “I want to be on ‘Game of Thrones’ so badly,” he said. 

It’s unclear whether Drake has reached out to HBO about appearing on the show, but it seems likely that the network would be open to the idea. After all, Drake is a massive star and his appearance could help bring in new viewers.

It's been one of the best-kept secrets in the entertainment industry, but there's a chance that Drake will actually make an appearance on Game of Thrones.

Rumors about Drake's involvement first started to circulate in early 2018, and fans have been eagerly waiting for confirmation ever since. While HBO has yet to announce anything official, there's a good chance that Drake will show up in an upcoming episode of the hit series.

So what can we expect from Drake's appearance on Game of Thrones? It's hard to say, but rapper Lil Jon recently hinted that the show might be planning something big.
