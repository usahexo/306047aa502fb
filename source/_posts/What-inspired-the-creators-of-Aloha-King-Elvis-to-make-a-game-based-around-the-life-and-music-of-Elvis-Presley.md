#  What inspired the creators of Aloha King Elvis to make a game based around the life and music of Elvis Presley?

The creators of Aloha King Elvis say they were inspired by the life and music of Elvis Presley to make a game based around the King of Rock and Roll.

“Elvis is an icon,” says creator Stephen Richards. “He is someone who defined an era and created a style of music that is still popular today. We wanted to create a game that would allow players to experience his life and music firsthand.”

Richards and his team drew on their own love of Elvis’s music to craft a game that they say pays tribute to the singer in every way possible. They consulted with experts on Elvis’s life and career to ensure the game was historically accurate, while also incorporating plenty of action and humor.

In Aloha King Elvis, players take on the role of Elvis himself, starting out as a young singer in Memphis and working their way up through the ranks to become one of the most famous entertainers in history. Along the way, they must navigate the challenges of fame while performing some of Elvis’s biggest hits.

According to Richards, one of the main goals of the game is to show players what it was like to be Elvis. “We wanted people to feel like they are really living his life, from the highs of superstardom to the lows of personal struggles,” he says. “We think we’ve created something that captures all aspects of Elvis’s career and provides an enjoyable gaming experience at the same time.”
