As the new NFL season rapidly approaches, so too does the opportunity to put some money down on who will take home the Vince Lombardi trophy. If you're looking to add a bit of excitement to the upcoming season, or if you're just looking for a good way to make a bit of extra cash, then why not try your luck at sports betting?

The Patriots are always one of the favorites to win the Super Bowl, and with good reason – they always have one of the strongest teams in the league. This year is no exception, and with Tom Brady under center they are almost guaranteed to at least make it to the playoffs. As such, New England is probably your best bet for a Super Bowl win this year.

2. The Green Bay Packers

The Packers have consistently been one of the top teams in the league over the past few years, and this looks like it will continue in 2017. Led by quarterback Aaron Rodgers, Green Bay is sure to be a force to be reckoned with this season. They'll be a good pick if you're looking for an upset victory in the playoffs.

3. The Pittsburgh Steelers

The Steelers had a bit of a rough patch last year but they seem to have recovered well and should be back in contention this season. With quarterback Ben Roethlisberger and wide receiver Antonio Brown leading the offense, Pittsburgh has more than enough firepower to take down any opponent. Look for them to go far in this year's playoffs.

4. The Dallas Cowboys

The Cowboys had a disappointing season last year but they look like they've made some changes that should help them improve this year. Led by quarterback Dak Prescott and running back Ezekiel Elliott, Dallas is still one of the most dangerous teams in the league and is definitely worth betting on this season.

5. The Atlanta Falcons

The Falcons had an incredible 2016 season but came up just short in their quest for the Super Bowl title. This year they'll be looking to make up for that disappointment and come out on top; don't be surprised if they manage it! With quarterback Matt Ryan and wide receiver Julio Jones leading the offense, Atlanta has more than enough firepower to take down any opponent

#  Get Your Sport Fix at the Casino

If you’re a fan of sport and enjoy a flutter on the horses, greyhounds or dogs then the casino is the place for you. All of the UK’s major bookmakers have betting shops located in or close to casinos, so you can put your money where your mouth is.

The most popular sports for betting are horse racing, football and rugby, but there’s plenty of other options to choose from including cricket, golf, tennis and boxing. In fact, there’s so much variety on offer that you could potentially never back the same horse or team twice.

Of course, with any form of gambling there is always the potential to lose money, so it’s important to gamble responsibly and set yourself sensible limits. That way you can enjoy a bit of sport betting without having to worry about ruining your finances.

So if you want to get your sport fix at the casino, here are some tips to help you along the way:

o Choose a reputable bookmaker – There are plenty of bookmakers to choose from, but not all of them are reputable. Make sure you do your research before selecting a bookie so that you know you can trust them with your money.

o Study the form – Whether you’re betting on horses, football or rugby, it’s important to do your research and study the form. This will give you a good idea about which teams or horses are likely to win and which ones are worth backing.

o Use free bets – Many bookmakers offer free bets as an incentive for new customers. If you’re looking to place a few bets, then make sure you take advantage of these freebies.

o Gamble responsibly – As mentioned earlier, it’s important to gamble responsibly when betting on sports. Make sure you set yourself sensible limits and never bet more than you can afford to lose.
