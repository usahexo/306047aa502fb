#  Police Arrest 19 People in Major Online Gambling Bust

Police in the United States have arrested 19 people as part of a major crackdown on online gambling.

The arrests were made in connection with an FBI investigation that began more than two years ago.

The suspects are accused of participating in a wide-ranging racketeering conspiracy that involved millions of dollars in illegal gambling profits.

According to federal prosecutors, the suspects used offshore websites to illegally gamble on sporting events, including college and professional football, basketball, and baseball games.

They also allegedly ran an illegal money laundering operation that processed millions of dollars in bets.

Prosecutors say the defendants took advantage of lax state and federal laws to operate their illegal business from across the United States.

“The defendants charged in this case allegedly conducted an expansive sports betting and money laundering conspiracy that crossed state lines and international borders,” said Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. “Combating illegal online gambling is a priority for the Department of Justice.”

All 19 defendants were indicted by a federal grand jury on charges including conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering. If convicted, they could face up to 20 years in prison.

#  FBI Warns of Growing Online Gambling Scams

The FBI has warned the public of a growing scam in which fraudsters pose as legitimate online casinos in order to steal money from players.

In a statement, the FBI said that it has “received numerous complaints from individuals who have been scammed by these criminals”. The bureau added that it was working with partners in law enforcement to investigate and shut down the scam operations.

The fake casinos use social media and other online platforms to lure players in, promising them “large sums of money for little or no risk”. However, once players have deposited their money, the casinos disappear, taking the funds with them.

According to the FBI, these scams are often conducted by organized crime groups, and can result in significant financial losses for victims.

So far this year, there have been more than two dozen reported cases of online gambling fraud in the US alone. In one recent case, a victim lost more than $200,000 to a scammer posing as an online casino.

To protect yourself against online gambling scams, be wary of any offers that seem too good to be true, and never give out your personal information or banking details to unknown websites. If you think you may have been scammed, report it to the FBI immediately.

#  $300 Million Seized in international online gambling crackdown

In coordinated efforts, law enforcement agencies from over a dozen countries seized nearly $300 million in connection with illegal online gambling operations. The operations were said to have spanned across four continents and involved networks of organized crime.

Attorney General Loretta Lynch called the crackdown “one of the largest multi-national stings in history” and praised the international cooperation among law enforcement agencies.

Details on the specific raids and arrests are still emerging, but it is known that investigators targeted a wide range of online gambling activities, including sports betting, poker and casino games.

The investigation is said to have been ongoing for several years and was aided by new technological advances that made it easier to track illegal online gambling activity. This included the use of undercover agents and sophisticated analytical tools to identify suspects and their related networks.

The crackdown comes as no surprise to industry experts, who have long warned about the growth of illegal online gambling. In recent years there has been a concerted effort by both regulators and law enforcement to crack down on the sector, which is seen as a major threat to traditional brick-and-mortar casinos.

While online gambling is legal in some countries, including Australia and the UK, it is prohibited in others, such as the US. This has created a complex regulatory environment that has led to much of the industry operating in a grey area.

This ambiguity has allowed illegal operators to flourish, often beyond the reach of authorities. However, with this latest crackdown, it seems that regulators are finally starting to get serious about tackling the problem.

#  Two Men Sentenced for Online Gambling Fraud

Two men were sentenced on Monday for their involvement in an online gambling fraud scheme.

According to prosecutors, the two men operated an illegal online sports betting site that defrauded customers out of more than $1 million.

Both men were convicted of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering. The man who operated the website was sentenced to five years in prison, while the man who handled customer payments was sentenced to three years in prison.

In addition to prison time, the two men were ordered to forfeit $1.5 million.

#  Woman Pleads Guilty to Defrauding Online Casino

A woman from the United Kingdom has pleaded guilty to defrauding an online casino of more than £7 million. The woman, who is in her thirties, admitted to taking money from the casino by creating multiple accounts and withdrawing large sums of cash. She then laundered the money through her bank account and other businesses she controlled.

The woman was caught after the casino became suspicious about the number of transactions being made from her accounts. They contacted the police, who then launched an investigation. Officers found that the woman had created bogus companies and bank accounts to disguise where the money was coming from.

She has now been sentenced to four years in prison and will have to repay £7.2 million to the casino. This case highlights the importance of robust anti-fraud measures for online casinos. By using sophisticated technology and working with law enforcement agencies, casinos can help protect themselves against criminals like this woman.
