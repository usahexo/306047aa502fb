#  How to Unlock the Dungeon Roulette Level 70

It's probably no secret to you that progressing beyond level 69 in the dungeon roulette can be quite a challenge. With the right team and enough luck, however, it is possible to make it to level 70. In this article, we'll discuss some tips and tricks that will help you on your way.

The first step is to build a strong team. For this, you'll want to make sure you have heroes of all colors - red, green, blue and yellow. Each color has its own strengths and weaknesses, so it's important to have a balance.

Your team should also be well-equipped. Make sure you have plenty of healing potions and mana potions (or spells), as well as armor and weapons of all types. The better equipped your team is, the easier it will be to progress through the levels.

Once you've got your team built, it's time to start leveling them up. The higher their levels are, the more damage they'll do and the more health they'll have. You can increase your team's levels by battling in the dungeon roulette or by doing quests for the Adventurers' Guild.

Now it's time for the most important part - luck! You'll need plenty of luck on your side if you want to make it past level 69 and on to level 70. There are several things you can do to increase your chances of success:


1) Use a champion orb before starting a battle - this will give your team an advantage over the enemy team.

2) Try to avoid battles against teams that are much stronger than yours - this will decrease your chances of winning.

3) Use buffing spells or items before starting a battle - these will help your team perform better in battle.

4) If all else fails, retreat and try another battle until you find one that is more favorable to you.

#  Get Your Chance at the Level 70 Dungeon Roulette!

In Patch 7.2, the Tomb of Sargeras was unlocked, and with it, a new set of weekly quests for players at level 70. These quests offer rewards in the form of Challenger's Seals, which can be used to purchase pieces of the Vestments of the Unseen Prophet from Aluriel in the Broken Shore.

But what many players may not know is that these quests also offer a chance at the Level 70 Dungeon Roulette. This roulette offers a chance to receive a random dungeon challenge at level 70, with a potential reward of 3000 Nethershards and a piece of gear from Tier 21.

To participate in the Level 70 Dungeon Roulette, you first need to complete The Ultimate Challenge: Defeat Kil'jaeden. This is a weekly quest that awards Challenger's Seals, which are then used to purchase items from Aluriel. Once you have completed The Ultimate Challenge, you simply need to speak to Aluriel and select the "Open Level 70 Dungeon Roulette" option.

Aluriel will then ask you to choose a Keystone level. Once you have made your choice, she will teleport you to one of four randomly selected level 70 dungeons.

The four possible dungeons are: The Nighthold, Seat of the Triumvirate, Violet Hold, or Eye of Azshara.

Once inside the dungeon, you will have to complete its challenge mode and then exit normally. Upon completion, you will be awarded with 3000 Nethershards and a piece of gear from Tier 21.

The Level 70 Dungeon Roulette can be a great way to get some extra rewards and challenge yourself with some difficult content. So don't forget to check it out when you're done with the Tomb of Sargeras!
