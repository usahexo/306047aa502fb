#  How many jobs would legalizing activities betting create Netherlands? 

The Netherlands government concluded a study in 2017 that estimated that the country could gain anywhere from 9,000 to 24,000 jobs by legalizing all forms of sports betting.

The Randstad region of the Netherlands would be the biggest beneficiary of this policy change, accounting for up to 60 percent of new positions. The Amsterdam metropolitan area would see an influx of up to 13,000 new jobs, while Rotterdam would claim 6,000 new positions. Utrecht and The Hague would each see gains of around 1,000 jobs apiece.

While it is clear that legalizing sports betting in the Netherlands would create thousands of new jobs, there are still some potential downsides that need to be considered. These potential downsides include an increase in addiction rates and an increase in criminal activity.

Despite these potential risks, the overall benefits of legalizing sports betting appear to far outweigh the potential drawbacks. This is why many experts are calling on the Dutch government to legalize all forms of sports betting as soon as possible.

#  Study shows legalizing activities betting would create over 10,000 jobs Netherlands 

A recently published study by the H2 Gambling Capital consultancy shows that legalizing sports betting in the Netherlands would create over 10,000 jobs in the country. The study also indicates that tax revenue generated by legalized betting would be significant, as much as €550 million per year.

Currently, gambling in the Netherlands is only legal in a limited number of casinos. This means that most gambling takes place illegally, which creates significant criminal activity and black market economic activity. Legalizing sports betting would bring this business into the open, where it could be regulated and taxed.

Supporters of legalizing sports betting say that doing so would provide a new revenue stream for the government while also creating jobs. They note that other countries such as the United Kingdom have seen significant benefits from legalization, with tax revenue from gambling topping £2 billion per year.

Opponents of legalization argue that it could lead to addiction problems and increase crime rates. They also maintain that the government should not be involved in what is essentially a private activity.

#  Legalizing activities betting could create 24,000 jobs in Netherlands 

The Hague – A new study by Dutch research company commissioned by the Calvin Ayre Foundation has found that legalizing gambling activities could create 24,000 jobs in the Netherlands.
The research company, Profundo, also released a report in June of this year that claims that 2.9 million people in the Netherlands participate in some form of illegal gambling, which is six percent of the population. The same report claims that legalizing all gambling activities could bring in €452 million euros in tax revenue.
The Netherlands is one of the few European countries without a regulated gambling market. This means that most gambling takes place illegally. 

“The fact that so many Dutch citizens are engaged in illegal gambling means that there is a lot of money flowing around outside of the government coffers,” according to Calvin Ayre, founder of the Calvin Ayre Foundation and Bodog entertainment brand. “This study shows that regulating and taxing gambling would be a huge boost to the Dutch economy and would create thousands of jobs.”

The research also found that there is a close correlation between illegal gambling and crime rates. In areas where there is more illegal gambling, there is also higher levels of organized crime and fraud. 

Revenue from legal gambling could be used to fund programs to help combat these problems. For example, it could be used to fund treatment programs for problem gamblers or to finance anti-fraud initiatives. 

Currently, there are no plans to legalize gambling in the Netherlands, but this study provides convincing evidence that it would be a wise move for the government.

#  Activities betting creates nearly 25,000 jobs in the Netherlands 

Activities betting creates nearly 25,000 jobs in the Netherlands, while football gambling alone employs approximately 1,600 people. This is according to research by the Netherlands Gaming Authority (NGA), which was unveiled last week.

The regulator carried out an investigation into the employment effects of the gaming industry, looking at both land-based and remote betting activities. The study found that across the Netherlands, the gaming industry employs a total of 24,754 people. Of these, 13,614 work in land-based casinos and gaming halls, while 11,140 are employed in remote betting activities such as online and telephone betting.

The NGA said that its figures show that the gaming industry is a major employer in the Netherlands. “Gambling is not just a pastime for a few people; it is also a substantial source of jobs for many Dutch people”, commented Director Gert van der Veen.

The news will be welcomed by the casino and betting sector, which has been lobbying for years for liberalisation of the Dutch market. The sector has argued that liberalisation would create jobs and boost tax revenues. However, opponents of liberalisation claim that it would lead to an increase in problem gambling rates.

The NGA’s research provides some evidence to back up both sides of the argument. The study found that there were currently around 380,000 problem gamblers in the Netherlands, representing around 2% of the population aged 18 and over. However, if liberalisation were to take place, this could rise to 690,000 problem gamblers (3.5% of population).

#  Activities betting generates thousands of new jobs in the Netherlands

The Dutch government has announced that a new report shows that the legalisation of sports betting in the Netherlands has generated thousands of jobs in the country. The figures, released by research company Ecorys, show that there are now over 4,000 people employed in the betting industry in the Netherlands, up from just 350 before it was legalised in 2012.

This is great news for the Dutch economy and highlights how gambling can be a major driver of growth and job creation. It is also testament to the benefits of legalisation, as opposed to prohibition, as it allows for better regulation and oversight of the industry.

This trend is being seen around the world, with gaming now being one of the fastest-growing sectors in the global economy. In fact, according to a report by PwC, the global gaming market is expected to grow at a rate of 7.5% over the next few years, reaching a value of $US601 billion by 2020. This is due to rising consumer demand for entertainment and socialising online, as well as increasing availability of betting products.

The Netherlands is well placed to capitalise on this growth, with a thriving gaming industry and a favourable regulatory environment. With its population of 17 million people, it offers a large potential market for gaming companies. In addition, its close proximity to other major European markets means that Dutch companies can easily expand into other countries if desired.

All in all, this looks like great news for Dutch gamers and for the country’s economy as a whole. It is clear that gambling can be a major contributor to growth and job creation, and that legalisation is key to unlocking these benefits.
