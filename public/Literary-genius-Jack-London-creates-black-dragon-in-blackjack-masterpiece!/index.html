Dragons are among the most popular and feared creatures in mythology and legend, and to see one brought to life in the form of a blackjack hand was nothing short of genius.</p>
<p>Interestingly, London didn’t create the black dragon purely out of imagination. He based it on a real phenomenon that can often occur when playing blackjack. In particular, London was inspired by a situation where both the dealer and player have blackjacks. This creates a rare and powerful hand known as a dragon.</p>
<p>The black dragon is so feared because it has the potential to win both the dealer’s hand and the player’s hand. In fact, it’s possible for the player to win even if they are dealt two blackjacks! Needless to say, this makes for an intense and dramatic game.</p>
<p>It’s no wonder that London was drawn to write about the black dragon in blackjack. He knew that it could create spellbinding stories with characters who were fiercely determined to win - or lose - their fortunes. Thanks to London’s writing, the black dragon has become one of the most iconic symbols in all of gambling history.</p>
<h1 id="Black-Dragon-in-Blackjack-a-dark-and-powerful-tale-of-love-and-loss"><a href="#Black-Dragon-in-Blackjack-a-dark-and-powerful-tale-of-love-and-loss" class="headerlink" title="Black Dragon in Blackjack a dark and powerful tale of love and loss"></a>Black Dragon in Blackjack a dark and powerful tale of love and loss</h1><p>In the casinos of Las Vegas, the black dragon is a feared creature. Sightings of this beast are rare, but when they occur, the consequences are disastrous.</p>
<p>No one knows this better than Vincent. Vincent was a promising young blackjack player, until he encountered the black dragon. In one fateful night, Vincent lost everything: his money, his self-respect, and most importantly, his love.</p>
<p>Vincent met Jane at the casino. She was beautiful and kind, and they quickly fell in love. They gambled together late into the night, always coming back to their favorite table to play blackjack.</p>
<p>One evening, they were playing at their usual table when the black dragon appeared. The dragon was massive and dark, its eyes glowing with menace. It roared and breathed fire, scattering the players and dealers alike.</p>
<p>In the chaos, Vincent lost sight of Jane. He desperately searched for her, but she was nowhere to be found. The only thing left behind was her discarded cardigan lying on the floor next to the empty chair where she had been sitting moments before.</p>
<p>It was only later that Vincent realized what had happened: the black dragon had taken Jane away. In despair, he fled Las Vegas and never returned.</p>
<p>Now, years later, Vincent is a broken man. He has never forgotten Jane, and still mourns her loss every day. But he knows he can’t keep living in the past; he must find a way to move on and forgive himself for what happened.</p>
<p>Perhaps some day he will return to Las Vegas and face the black dragon once again…</p>

I’m an English teacher, so it’s kind of my job. But I don’t often gush about the novels I read. Black Dragon in Blackjack by D.S. Neal is one of those rare exceptions.</p>
<p>This book is darn near perfect! From the intriguing premise to the thrilling action scenes, Black Dragon in Blackjack kept me glued to the pages from start to finish. The characters are well developed and likable, and the plot is perfectly paced.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for an exciting new read, you need look no further than this novel!</p>

There’s a new dragon in town, and its name is blackjack. In this blackjack strategy guide, we’ll teach you how to play as the dragon and crush your opponents.</p>
<p>First, let’s take a look at the basic rules of blackjack:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The player competes against the dealer, not against other players.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The goal is to achieve 21 points total or to come as close as possible without going over 21.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Aces are worth 1 or 11 points, whichever is more advantageous to the player.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Face cards (jacks, queens, and kings) are worth 10 points each.</p>
</li>
<li><p>All other cards are worth their numerical value.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The player can hit (take another card) or stand (end the turn).</p>
</li>
<li><p>If the player goes over 21, he loses automatically.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The dealer must hit on 16 and Stand on 17.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Now that you know the basics of blackjack, let’s move on to the dragon strategy:</p>
<pre><code>4 Black Dragon Playing Tips for Blackjack Success 1) Play conservatively until you&#39;ve got a feel for the game - Don&#39;t go all in on your first hand! Start by betting low amounts and increase your bets as you become more comfortable with the game mechanics and possibilities. Remember - it&#39;s better to lose a small amount slowly than to risk everything and lose big time! 2) Use basic strategy charts to guide your plays - These handy charts will tell you what to do in every possible situation during a game of blackjack, whether you&#39;re playing as the dragon or not. You can find charts for free online, or purchase an illustrated guidebook with all the information you need compiled in one place - perfect for taking to casinos with you! 3) Bet on black whenever possible - This may seem like an obvious tip, but it&#39;s nonetheless crucial advice when playing as the dragon! Black is statistically the most likely colour to come up when spinning the roulette wheel, so put your money where your mouth is and make some profits while gambling! 4) Use your powers of observation wisely - As we all know, dragons are very smart creatures! Use this intelligence while playing blackjack by watching which cards your opponents are picking up and discarding (keeping an eye out especially for face cards). This information can give you valuable insights into their hand strengths and weaknesses - knowledge that can help you win big in future hands!
