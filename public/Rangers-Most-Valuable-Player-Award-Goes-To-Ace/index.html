        </div>
        <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
      		<h1 id="Rangers-Most-Valuable-Player-Award-Goes-To-Ace"><a href="#Rangers-Most-Valuable-Player-Award-Goes-To-Ace" class="headerlink" title="Rangers Most Valuable Player Award Goes To Ace"></a>Rangers Most Valuable Player Award Goes To Ace</h1><p>The Rangers MVP for the 2017 season goes to their ace pitcher, who not only led the team in innings pitched but also had an impressive record of 17-10. </p>
<p>This was no easy decision, as the Rangers had a number of very talented players this season. But the ace’s contribution was simply too important to overlook, and he proved himself time and again when the team needed him most.</p>
<p>In addition to his impressive pitching stats, the ace also contributed greatly to the team’s morale and overall chemistry. He is a respected leader on the mound and sets an excellent example for his teammates.</p>
<p>The Rangers are optimistic that they can build on their success from this past season and make another run at the playoffs in 2018. With their ace leading the way, there’s no doubt that they have a great chance of doing just that.</p>
<h1 id="Historic-Night-for-Ace-as-Rangers-Win-their-First-Pennant"><a href="#Historic-Night-for-Ace-as-Rangers-Win-their-First-Pennant" class="headerlink" title="Historic Night for Ace as Rangers Win their First Pennant"></a>Historic Night for Ace as Rangers Win their First Pennant</h1><p>In a game that will long be remembered in Texas, the Rangers won their first pennant in franchise history. With ace pitcher Cliff Lee on the mound, they defeated the New York Yankees 5-2 in Game 6 of the American League Championship Series.</p>
<p>The Rangers got off to a fast start, scoring three runs in the third inning. Josh Hamilton drove in two runs with a double, and Ian Kinsler added an RBI single.</p>
<p>The Yankees made a run of their own in the fourth inning, but Cliff Lee held them off. He allowed just two runs on six hits over eight innings to earn the victory.</p>
<p>The Rangers bullpen then held on for the final two innings to seal the win. Neftali Feliz got the save, pitching a scoreless ninth inning.</p>
<p>Rangers fans went wild after the game, celebrating their team’s first pennant ever. “This is unbelievable,” said one fan. “I can’t believe we did it!”</p>
<p>The Rangers will now face the San Francisco Giants in the World Series. It will be Texas’s first trip to the World Series since they were founded as an expansion team in 1961.</p>
<h1 id="Ace’s-Pitching-Brings-Texas-its-Second-Pennant-in-a-Row"><a href="#Ace’s-Pitching-Brings-Texas-its-Second-Pennant-in-a-Row" class="headerlink" title="Ace’s Pitching Brings Texas its Second Pennant in a Row"></a>Ace’s Pitching Brings Texas its Second Pennant in a Row</h1><p>The ace of the Texas Rangers pitching staff, Yu Darvish, has been spectacular in the playoffs. He is mainly responsible for the Rangers making it to their second consecutive World Series. In Game 7 of the American League Championship Series against the Toronto Blue Jays, Darvish pitched 7 innings, allowing no runs on 2 hits while striking out 5 batters. He was able to do this despite dealing with a stiff neck that he sustained during his last start in the ALDS against the Astros.</p>
<p>The Rangers have relied on Darvish heavily this postseason. In 6 starts, he has pitched 36 innings, allowed only 4 runs (1 earned), and struck out 36 batters. His ERA in these 6 starts is only 0.25! Opposing hitters are batting only .088 against him.</p>
<p>Yu Darvish is certainly proving himself to be one of the best pitchers in baseball. He is a huge reason why the Rangers are headed back to the World Series.</p>
<h1 id="Ace-playing-out-of-this-world-in-post-season"><a href="#Ace-playing-out-of-this-world-in-post-season" class="headerlink" title="Ace playing out of this world in post season"></a>Ace playing out of this world in post season</h1><p>The New York Yankees ace, Luis Severino, has been pitching out of this world in the post season. Heading into game one of the American League Divisional Series against the Boston Red Sox, Severino had not allowed a run in thirteen innings pitched. In game one, he pitched six innings, surrendered two hits and two walks, while striking out seven batters.<br>It was more of the same in game two as Severino pitched seven shut-out innings while only allowing three hits and one walk. He struck out eight batters in total, which helped him improve his postseason ERA to 0.00.<br>This superhuman performance is a far cry from his regular season stats. Severino finished the year with an 18-8 record and a 3.39 ERA. While he was very good during the regular season, it appears that he has stepped it up another notch in the playoffs.<br>What could be causing this drastic change? There are a few possible explanations. For one, Severino may simply be elevating his game when it matters most. Additionally, he could be feeling extra pressure to live up to high expectations after signing a four-year contract extension worth $52 million last month.<br>Finally, it’s also possible that fatigue played a role in his struggles during the regular season. Severino threw an MLB-leading 215 innings this year and may have been starting to wear down near the end of the season.</p>
<p>Regardless of the reasons for his struggles during the regular season, Severino has been absolutely dominant in the playoffs thus far. He will need to continue this impressive streak if the Yankees want to make a run at their 28th World Series championship.</p>
<h1 id="Ace-leads-Rangers-to-Victory-in-the-World-Series"><a href="#Ace-leads-Rangers-to-Victory-in-the-World-Series" class="headerlink" title="Ace leads Rangers to Victory in the World Series"></a>Ace leads Rangers to Victory in the World Series</h1><p>Last night, the Texas Rangers clinched their first-ever World Series title with a 6-2 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals in Game 7. The Rangers were led by their ace pitcher, Cliff Lee, who pitched a complete game and allowed only two runs.</p>
<p>The Rangers got on the board first in the top of the third inning, when David Murphy hit a solo home run. They added to their lead in the fifth inning, when Nelson Cruz hit a two-run homer.</p>
<p>The Cardinals got on the scoreboard in the bottom of the sixth inning, when Matt Holliday hit a solo home run. But the Rangers responded later in the inning, when Adrian Beltre hit a two-run homer to give them a 6-1 lead.</p>
<p>The Cardinals tried to make a comeback in the bottom of the ninth inning, but they were unable to get any closer than two runs. Cliff Lee then closed out the game by getting Albert Pujols to ground out to second base.</p>
<p>This was an exciting World Series, with seven games that were all decided by one run. The Rangers proved to be dominant champions, and they now have their place in history as one of baseball’s great teams.</p>
