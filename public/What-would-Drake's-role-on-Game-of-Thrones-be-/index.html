                <h1>What would Drake's role on Game of Thrones be</h1>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
      		<h1 id="What-would-Drake’s-role-on-Game-of-Thrones-be"><a href="#What-would-Drake’s-role-on-Game-of-Thrones-be" class="headerlink" title="What would Drake’s role on Game of Thrones be?"></a>What would Drake’s role on Game of Thrones be?</h1><p>Drake is a Canadian rapper, singer, songwriter, and actor. He first gained recognition in 2009 from his role on the television series Degrassi: The Next Generation. Drake would be an excellent candidate for the role of Theon Greyjoy on Game of Thrones.</p>
<p>Theon Greyjoy is a character that has a tortured past. He was raised by his father Balon Greyjoy to be the heir to the Iron Islands, but was taken hostage by the Stark family at a young age. He eventually became part of the Stark household and was treated poorly by Robb Stark. After Robb’s death, Theon decided to betray House Stark and take Winterfell for himself, but was ultimately defeated by Ramsay Bolton and his forces.</p>
<p>Drake has shown that he can play a character with a tortured past in his role on Degrassi: The Next Generation. He would be able to bring depth to Theon Greyjoy’s character and help viewers connect with him. Additionally, Drake is no stranger to performing in front of large audiences or working under high pressure conditions, both of which would be necessary for a successful role on Game of Thrones.</p>
<h1 id="Why-do-fans-think-that-Drake-should-appear-on-the-show"><a href="#Why-do-fans-think-that-Drake-should-appear-on-the-show" class="headerlink" title="Why do fans think that Drake should appear on the show?"></a>Why do fans think that Drake should appear on the show?</h1><p>There are many reasons why fans believe that Drake should appear on the show. Some feel that he would be a perfect fit, given his Canadian roots. Others think that he could bring some much-needed celebrity firepower to the series. </p>
<p>Drake has shown interest in the show in the past. In a 2017 interview with Beats 1 Radio, he said that he’d love to make an appearance on “Game of Thrones”. “I want to be on ‘Game of Thrones’ so badly,” he said. </p>
<p>It’s unclear whether Drake has reached out to HBO about appearing on the show, but it seems likely that the network would be open to the idea. After all, Drake is a massive star and his appearance could help bring in new viewers. </p>
<p>Whether or not Drake appears on “Game of Thrones” remains to be seen, but fans will undoubtedly continue to debate the topic.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-some-of-the-reasons-that-fans-have-come-up-with-for-why-Drake-should-appear-on-the-show"><a href="#What-are-some-of-the-reasons-that-fans-have-come-up-with-for-why-Drake-should-appear-on-the-show" class="headerlink" title="What are some of the reasons that fans have come up with for why Drake should appear on the show?"></a>What are some of the reasons that fans have come up with for why Drake should appear on the show?</h1><p>One of the most popular rappers in the world, Drake has won over the hearts of millions with his soulful music. So it’s no surprise that fans have been clamoring for him to make an appearance on “Game of Thrones.” Here are some of the most popular theories about why he should show up on the show:</p>
<ol>
<li>He could be a Targaryen.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some believe that Drake is actually a Targaryen, due to his Canadian heritage and reddish hair. What better way to link him back to his Targaryen heritage than by having him appear on “Game of Thrones?”</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>He could help Jon Snow defeat the White Walkers.</li>
</ol>
<p>Drake is known for being a formidable opponent, and many believe that he could help Jon Snow in his fight against the White Walkers. With his powerful lyrics and emotional ballads, Drake could provide much-needed support to the Night’s Watch.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>He could team up with Daenerys Targaryen.</li>
</ol>
<p>What would be more epic than seeing Drake team up with Daenerys Targaryen? The two powerful forces could help each other take down their enemies and finally rule the Seven Kingdoms.</p>
<h1 id="How-would-Drake’s-appearance-on-Game-of-Thrones-impact-the-show"><a href="#How-would-Drake’s-appearance-on-Game-of-Thrones-impact-the-show" class="headerlink" title="How would Drake’s appearance on Game of Thrones impact the show?"></a>How would Drake’s appearance on Game of Thrones impact the show?</h1><p>Drake’s cameo on the hit HBO show “Game of Thrones” is sure to cause a stir among fans. The rapper’s appearance is already generating a lot of buzz on social media, with some people speculating that his role could be significant.</p>
<p>It’s unclear what Drake will be doing on the show, but some are betting that he’ll play a musician in King’s Landing. Others think he may just make a brief appearance in a scene with Tyrion Lannister.</p>
<p>No matter what his role turns out to be, Drake’s appearance is sure to generate a lot of publicity for “Game of Thrones” and could potentially attract new fans to the show.</p>
<h1 id="Is-there-a-chance-that-Drake-will-actually-appear-on-Game-of-Thrones"><a href="#Is-there-a-chance-that-Drake-will-actually-appear-on-Game-of-Thrones" class="headerlink" title="Is there a chance that Drake will actually appear on Game of Thrones?"></a>Is there a chance that Drake will actually appear on Game of Thrones?</h1><p>It’s been one of the best-kept secrets in the entertainment industry, but there’s a chance that Drake will actually make an appearance on Game of Thrones.</p>
<p>Rumors about Drake’s involvement first started to circulate in early 2018, and fans have been eagerly waiting for confirmation ever since. While HBO has yet to announce anything official, there’s a good chance that Drake will show up in an upcoming episode of the hit series.</p>
<p>So what can we expect from Drake’s appearance on Game of Thrones? It’s hard to say, but rapper Lil Jon recently hinted that the show might be planning something big. “I just did a song with Drake for Game of Thrones. I can’t tell you what it is, but it’s fucking amazing,” he said in a recent interview.</p>
<p>Given that Lil Jon has worked with Drake in the past, his comments are certainly worth taking seriously. It seems likely that the show is gearing up for a big reveal, and there’s a good chance that Drake will play a key role.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, HBO recently registered two new domain names: gameofthronesseason8episode5drakeandjon.com and gameofthronesseason8episode6drakeandjonshow.com. While this doesn’t confirm anything, it does suggest that HBO is planning something special for Drake’s appearance on the show.</p>
<p>At this point, all we can do is wait and see what happens. But if past appearances are any indication, Drake is sure to make a huge impact on Game of Thrones.</p>
