      		<h1 id="IRS-Will-Know-How-Many-Millions-You-Win-Gambling-on-Pearls-Fortune-Game"><a href="#IRS-Will-Know-How-Many-Millions-You-Win-Gambling-on-Pearls-Fortune-Game" class="headerlink" title="IRS Will Know How Many Millions You Win Gambling on Pearls Fortune Game"></a>IRS Will Know How Many Millions You Win Gambling on Pearls Fortune Game</h1><p>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is now set to keep track of the amount of money US taxpayers win while gambling on a new mobile game called Pearls Fortune.</p>
<p>According to a report in The Wall Street Journal, the IRS will use the winnings data from Pearls Fortune players to help identify people who may not be reporting all of their income on their tax returns.</p>
<p>The Pearls Fortune game, which is available for free on the Apple App Store and Google Play, is a slot machine-style game that allows players to bet anywhere from 25 cents to $100 per spin.</p>
<p>As with any other form of gambling, playing Pearls Fortune could result in players winning or losing money. But now the IRS will know exactly how much money US taxpayers are winning – or losing – from playing the game.</p>
<p>“We are always looking for new ways to improve compliance with our tax laws, and this includes examining information reported on tax returns about certain types of gambling activity,” an IRS spokesman told The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p>So far, it’s not clear exactly how much money the IRS has collected from taxpayers who have won money while playing Pearls Fortune. But it’s likely that the agency will be keeping a close eye on those winnings moving forward.</p>
<p>The decision by the IRS to track gambling winnings from Pearls Fortune comes as no surprise given the recent focus by the agency on offshore tax evasion. In recent years, the IRS has been ramping up its efforts to crack down on individuals and businesses who are hiding money offshore in order to avoid paying taxes.</p>
<p>Last year, for example, the IRS announced that it had reached a settlement with Apple Inc. that would require the technology giant to pay $16 billion in back taxes. And last month, it was revealed that HSBC Holdings PLC would be shelling out $1.9 billion to settle a long-running investigation into allegations that its Swiss banking arm had helped thousands of wealthy Americans evade taxes.</p>
<h1 id="How-the-IRS-Knows-What-Winnings-You-Get-From-Gambling-on-Pearls-Fortune-Game"><a href="#How-the-IRS-Knows-What-Winnings-You-Get-From-Gambling-on-Pearls-Fortune-Game" class="headerlink" title="How the IRS Knows What Winnings You Get From Gambling on Pearls Fortune Game"></a>How the IRS Knows What Winnings You Get From Gambling on Pearls Fortune Game</h1><p>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is a branch of the United States federal government that is responsible for collecting taxes. Part of the work of the IRS includes keeping track of gambling winnings and losses so that people who earn income from gambling can pay the appropriate amount of tax on their winnings.</p>
<p>People who play games of chance, such as slots, blackjack, and roulette, may be asked to report their gambling winnings on their annual tax return. The IRS keeps track of how much money people gamble away each year by monitoring popular gambling activities. So, if you happen to win big while playing Pearls Fortune slot game, the IRS will know about it.</p>
<p>If you have a net gambling loss for the year, you can deduct that amount from your taxable income. However, if your losses exceed your winnings, you cannot claim a net loss on your tax return. In order to claim a deduction for your gambling losses, you must itemize your deductions on Schedule A.</p>
<p>Gambling income includes not only cash winnings but also the fair market value of any non-cash prizes won. For example, if you receive a free cruise or other gift card as a prize for winning a casino game, the value of that gift card would be included in your gambling income.</p>
<p>The good news is that there are some expenses related to gambling that you can deduct on your tax return even if you don’t itemize your deductions. These include transportation costs to and from a casino as well as any expenses related to buying or playing gambling games, such as tickets or chips.</p>
<p>So, whether you’re a casual gambler who occasionally enjoys playing slots at the casino or a professional poker player, it’s important to understand how the IRS handles gambling income and losses. By knowing what counts as taxable income and what can be deducted as expenses, you can make sure that you’re paying the correct amount of tax on your gambling wins and losses.</p>
<h1 id="IRS-to-Get-Information-from-Casinos-About-Gambling-Winnings-on-Pearls-Fortune-Game"><a href="#IRS-to-Get-Information-from-Casinos-About-Gambling-Winnings-on-Pearls-Fortune-Game" class="headerlink" title="IRS to Get Information from Casinos About Gambling Winnings on Pearls Fortune Game"></a>IRS to Get Information from Casinos About Gambling Winnings on Pearls Fortune Game</h1><p>Casinos will soon be sending the IRS information about big gambling winnings on the new Pearls Fortune game, as required by the recent gambling tax law.</p>
<p>The new law, which was signed into effect at the end of last year, requires casinos to report jackpots of $1,200 or more on the Pearls Fortune game to the IRS. This information will be used to help enforce new taxes on gambling winnings.</p>
<p>Pearls Fortune is a slot machine game that has been hugely popular since it was released last year. It is a five-reel game with 20 pay lines, and features a variety of bonus rounds that can lead to some huge payouts.</p>
<p>People who have won big on the Pearls Fortune game in recent months could be in for some surprise tax bills from the IRS. The new law applies to all forms of gambling winnings, not just those from casino games. So anyone who has won more than $1,200 in any form of gambling in 2018 will need to report those winnings to the IRS.</p>
<p>Gambling taxes have been a hot topic in the US in recent years. The federal government currently imposes a 25% tax on all gambling winnings over $5,000. In addition, many states also impose their own taxes on gambling winnings.</p>
<p>As the popularity of online casinos and other forms of gambling continues to grow, it is likely that we will see even more discussion about how best to tax these activities. For now, however, the focus is on enforcing the existing laws and making sure that everyone who wins more than $1,200 pays their fair share of taxes.</p>
<h1 id="How-Will-the-IRS-Know-If-I’ve-Won-gambling-on-Pearls-Fortune-game"><a href="#How-Will-the-IRS-Know-If-I’ve-Won-gambling-on-Pearls-Fortune-game" class="headerlink" title="How Will the IRS Know If I’ve Won gambling on Pearls Fortune game?"></a>How Will the IRS Know If I’ve Won gambling on Pearls Fortune game?</h1><p>When you play Pearls Fortune, the IRS will not be able to determine if you have won or not. The game is considered a form of entertainment and is not taxable. The IRS does not tax winnings from games of chance. Gambling winnings are only taxed if they are considered income. This means that you must have earned the money in some way other than gambling it. For example, if you win a prize in a casino, this would be considered income and would be taxed. However, if you simply gamble and happen to win, the winnings will not be taxed.</p>
<h1 id="Are-There-Any-Consequences-If-I-Win-Gambling-on-Pearls-Fortune-Game-and-Don’t-Report-It"><a href="#Are-There-Any-Consequences-If-I-Win-Gambling-on-Pearls-Fortune-Game-and-Don’t-Report-It" class="headerlink" title="Are There Any Consequences If I Win Gambling on Pearls Fortune Game and Don’t Report It?"></a>Are There Any Consequences If I Win Gambling on Pearls Fortune Game and Don’t Report It?</h1><p>If you hit the jackpot on Pearls Fortune and don’t report it, there could be some consequences.</p>
<p>Most jurisdictions require gambling winnings to be reported as taxable income. If you fail to report your gambling winnings, you may end up owing money to the government.</p>
<p> Additionally, if you are caught cheating or engaging in dishonest behavior while playing Pearls Fortune, your casino operator may ban you from their property. This means that you would not be able to play the game at that casino anymore and would lose any potential future winnings.</p>
