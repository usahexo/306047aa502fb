      		<h1 id="Kids-Allowed-at-New-Washington-Casino"><a href="#Kids-Allowed-at-New-Washington-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Kids Allowed at New Washington Casino!"></a>Kids Allowed at New Washington Casino!</h1><p>The long awaited opening of the brand new Washington casino is finally here, and with it comes a whole slew of new rules and regulations. One of the most talked about policies is that children under the age of 18 are now allowed into the casino!</p>
<p>While some people are up in arms about this new rule, others are looking forward to spending time at the casino with their families. Washington casino officials say that they made this change in order to be more inclusive and welcoming to all guests.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how this policy affects business at the casino. Some people are predicting that it will bring in more families and boost business, while others think that it will have the opposite effect. Only time will tell!</p>
<h1 id="Car-Seats-Encouraged-at-Washington-Casino"><a href="#Car-Seats-Encouraged-at-Washington-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Car Seats Encouraged at Washington Casino!"></a>Car Seats Encouraged at Washington Casino!</h1><p>Washington casino visitors will now be able to enjoy their time at the gambling establishment a little bit more safely with the recent addition of car seats. The casino has placed a number of them in the lobby and near the gaming tables in order to make sure that parents can keep an eye on their children while they gamble.</p>
<p>Many experts feel that this is a step in the right direction for the casino, as it will encourage families to visit and play together. This, in turn, is likely to lead to increased profits for the casino.</p>
<p>The decision to add car seats was made after the casino conducted a study that showed that an increasing number of families are visiting casinos together. In fact, the study found that almost 60% of all visitors are now families with children.</p>
<p>This new development is great news for parents who want to enjoy some gambling fun while still keeping an eye on their kids. It also eliminates the need for them to have to find a babysitter or leave their children unattended somewhere else in the casino.</p>
<h1 id="Minimum-Age-for-Slot-Machines-is-21-But-Kids-Are-Allowed-in-Rest-of-Casino"><a href="#Minimum-Age-for-Slot-Machines-is-21-But-Kids-Are-Allowed-in-Rest-of-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Minimum Age for Slot Machines is 21, But Kids Are Allowed in Rest of Casino!"></a>Minimum Age for Slot Machines is 21, But Kids Are Allowed in Rest of Casino!</h1><p>This is a strange law that I found out about while living in Las Vegas. The minimum age for slot machines is 21 years old, but kids are allowed in the casino! I’m not sure why this is, but it’s definitely a strange law.</p>
<p>I asked a few people about this and some said that it’s because the casinos want to make sure that the kids are with their parents, and others said that it’s because the casinos don’t want to lose any business from people who are under 21 years old.</p>
<p>I’m not sure which one of those is true, but it’s definitely a strange law. I don’t think I would want my kids going into a casino at all, let alone being able to play slots!</p>
<h1 id="Electric-Avenue-Game-Is-Only-for-Kids-Ages-6-and-Up"><a href="#Electric-Avenue-Game-Is-Only-for-Kids-Ages-6-and-Up" class="headerlink" title="Electric Avenue Game Is Only for Kids Ages 6 and Up!"></a>Electric Avenue Game Is Only for Kids Ages 6 and Up!</h1><p>Parents, this is the perfect game for kids who are just starting to learn how to count and add numbers. Electric Avenue Game is made by the popular toy company Learning Resources and is a great way to keep kids entertained while they are learning.</p>
<p>The concept of the game is very simple – players are trying to get their car from point A to point B, but along the way they will have to add up the numbers on the speed signs to make sure they are going the right speed. If players go too fast or too slow, they will either run into a police officer or get a ticket, which will deduct points from their final score.</p>
<p>What I like about this game is that it’s not just a one-time play – there are multiple ways to play, so kids can continue to improve their skills. There is a beginner level for younger kids who are just starting out, and an intermediate level for those who have some basic math skills. The advanced level is really challenging, and will test even the most math-savvy kids.</p>
<p>Since Electric Avenue Game only requires basic counting skills, it’s a great way to get kids interested in math at an early age. And because it’s so much fun, they won’t even realize they’re learning!</p>
<h1 id="Parents-Can-Leave-Kids-in-Car-While-They-Gamble-at-Washington’s-New-Casino"><a href="#Parents-Can-Leave-Kids-in-Car-While-They-Gamble-at-Washington’s-New-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Parents Can Leave Kids in Car While They Gamble at Washington’s New Casino!"></a>Parents Can Leave Kids in Car While They Gamble at Washington’s New Casino!</h1><p>As of Feb. 8., there are now 10 casinos in Washington, and one of them is just a 9-minute drive from my home. Parenting groups are up in arms about the new casino because parents can leave their kids unattended while they gamble inside.</p>
<p>The controversy started when reports surfaced that staff at the new Muckleshoot Casino had seen children left alone in cars for extended periods of time while their parents gambled. In one incident, a child was found locked inside a car with the windows rolled up on a day when temperatures reached 71 degrees!</p>
<p>Parents who leave their kids unattended in cars while they gamble are not only putting their children’s lives in danger, but they’re also breaking the law. Washington state law says that it is illegal to leave a child unattended in a car for more than five minutes. Children can quickly overheat in cars, even on relatively mild days.</p>
<p>Casinos need to do more to ensure that parents aren’t leaving their kids unattended while they gamble. Staff should be keeping an eye out for children who are left alone in cars, and casino security should be prepared to take action if necessary. Parents who leave their kids unattended in cars need to be held accountable for their actions.</p>
